# mid-project-coffee

Coffee is one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world and more than 125 million people rely on its production for their livelihoods. Their industry faces a challenge because many of these people are small to medium-sized coffee farmers who are struggling to earn a sufficient income for their families.

The Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) is a nonprofit organization working internationally to improve the quality of coffee and the lives of the people who produce it. The Q Program is a program by CQI which identifies quality coffees and brings them to market through a credible and verifiable system. However, the scoring process is hard and sometimes complicated, in particular for traditional farmers. Therefore, now I want to try to predict the score by machine learning.
